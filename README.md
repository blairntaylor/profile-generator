## Description

A app to build team member profiles and populate an HTML page in JavScript. Uses library of team classes, several npm for jest, inquirer, and file system. Complex JavaScript code refering pages to eachother and eventually populating an HTML page using template literals. Challenge was getting the information to populate at the end. Tempting to start over several times and reorganize the code blocks.

## Installation

Invoke the app using node index .js in the terminal and fork from github.

## Usage

Follow prompts for creating team members and create a team profile page.
